# Final-proyect-automated-people-counting_control
This is a repository for the final project of the digital electronics 2 course, which is an automated people counting control, programmed in C language for the pic 16f15244.

## Hardware Description
- product page[PIC16F15244](https://www.microchip.com/wwwproducts/en/PIC16F15244)
- Datasheet [PIC16F15244](http://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/DeviceDoc/PIC16F15213-14-23-24-43-44-Data-Sheet-DS40002195B.pdf) 
- Curiosity nano Schematic [PIC16F15244](https://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/DeviceDoc/PIC16F15244_Curiosity_Nano_Schematics.pdf)
- This MPU operates with Microchip's [XC8 user manual ](http://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/DeviceDoc/MPLAB_XC8_C_Compiler_User_Guide_for_PIC.pdf) compiler. 

## Software Description 
- [MPLAB® X IDE 5.40 or newer](https://www.microchip.com/en-us/development-tools-tools-and-software/mplab-x-ide)
- [MPLAB® XC8 2.20 or a newer compiler](https://www.microchip.com/en-us/development-tools-tools-and-software/mplab-ecosystem-downloads-archive)


## What is it for?
-This project is based on an automated counting of people, like the mechanical cash registers; but instead of using this principle which is very manual and somewhat robust, it uses programmed sensors that together with the pic already referenced serve to change the process from manual-mechanical to something more automated and digital, which facilitates the use and comfort of people.


## Elements 
- PIC16F15244
- micro-USB to USB cable  
- laser emitter module Ky-008 650nm Red 5v 5mw Ky008 point
- LCD display 16x2
- leds
- push buttons 
- photoresistors 
- resistors 
- transistors(2n2222)
- breadboard

## how to install it 
1. connect the Curiosity nano pic(16f15244) to the computer using the micro USB to USB cable.
2. then open the code designed in C language in the MPLAB (if you don't have the MPLAB IDE and XC8 COMPILER in your system, you must install them).
3. then compile and pass the code designed and generated by the MPLAB to the Curiosoty nano card.
4. finally the respective connections are made from the pic 16f15244 to the peripherals that will be used to carry out the physical assembly of the project.  

## use 
-the operation of this project is based on programming in C language the infrared sensors in the pic (16f15244), so that when installing the circuit in some entrance or stablishment of passage, perform the respective count of people who are entering or leaving the place; and in turn by means of an LCD screen and some LEDs report the current status of the number of people who are inside the site. In addition to this, push buttons were added so that the registration can be done manually, so that when a person enters or leaves the place, he/she can press the button and the counter will automatically mark the new data.


## Results Prototype
-The prototype of the project was made to validate its operation.
